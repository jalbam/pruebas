Description

Open source game combination of text adventure and RPG written in Microsoft QBasic (under MS-DOS 6.22).

It is one of my first games that I created in 1996 or 1997 (I can't remember), when I was about 12 years old (my birthday is in November). It is in Spanish language.

Runs natively under MS-DOS and compatible operating systems like Windows (you can use emulators like DosBox to run it under BeOS, Linux, *BSD, etc).
